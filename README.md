A functioning Study record desktop application

Description
- Coursework I did on my first year for course "user interface programming"
- In this desktop app users can create, read, update and delete information of students, courses and the grades associated
- A relational database is used to store the data

Technologies used
- Programming language: Java
- UI development: JavaFX and SceneBuilder
- Database access: memory-based relational database (previosly used a database in a cloud environment)

Configuration / running the app
- If you have Java, Maven and <a href="https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/">SceneBuilder</a> installed you can run this app easily
- Run from project root by using command: mvn clean javafx:run
- This builds and opens the application

Afterwords
- As this was a project I did during the first year of my studies, there are opportunities left for improvement.
