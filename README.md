# Opiskelijarekisteri
A student register desktop application

## Description
- A solo project, coursework for a user interface programming course
- In this desktop app users can create, read, update and delete information of students, courses and the grades associated
- A relational database is used to store the data

## Technologies used
- Programming language: Java
- UI development: JavaFX and SceneBuilder
- Database access: a relational database that is created to memory during initialization (changed from using a MariaDB database in a cloud environment)

## Configuration / running the app
- If you have Java, Maven and <a href="https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/">SceneBuilder</a> installed you can run this app easily
- Run from project root by using command: ``mvn clean javafx:run``
- This builds and opens the application

## Afterwords
- As this was a project I did during the first year of my studies, there are opportunities left for improvement.

## Screenshots
- I've included a few screen shots for visualisation:
